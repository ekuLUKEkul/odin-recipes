<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>First we start by making Italian <em>Biga</em>. This is a type of preferment that adds complexity to the flavours. To make this simply combine 100g of flour with 60ml of water and all of our yeast. Seal in an airtight jar and leave at room temperature for 24 hours.</li>
    <li>Once 24 hours has passed we should notice the yeast has expanded the dough. At this stage add the remaining 287g of flour, 190ml of water and the salt. Mix to combine and leave for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Once an hour has passed place the dough on a lightly floured surface. <strong>Use as little flour as possible, just enough to keep dough from sticking.</strong> Knead the dough for around 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Once the dough is smooth and can stretch thin enough to allow light to pass through without ripping split it into 2 equal portions and ball. Place them in lightly floured airtight containers and store in the fridge for a minimum of 48 hours. <em>Dough can be stored for up to a week.</em></li>
